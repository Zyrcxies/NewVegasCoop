# New Vegas Co-op

A co-op multiplayer mod for Fallout: New Vegas (Steam) for a host and 2-4 friends doing a playthrough together.

Early release (0.1.4): playable start to finish, with bugs. Players: get it from Nexus Mods; the mod page explains
the requirements and how to play. Discord: https://discord.gg/dU3g6CZK8F


## Requirements
- Fallout: New Vegas on Steam, with [xNVSE](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE/releases)
- To build: Visual Studio Community 2026 with "Desktop development with C++", and Git

## Building
1. Clone with the xNVSE code included: `git clone --recursive <repo url>`
   (already cloned? run `git submodule update --init`)
2. Optional, to copy the plugin into your game after each build: copy this into a new file `CMakeUserPresets.json` (it's personal, not committed) and set your game folder:
   ```json
   { "version": 6,
     "configurePresets": [{ "name": "local", "inherits": "x86",
       "cacheVariables": { "GAME_DIR": "C:/Path/To/Fallout New Vegas" } }],
     "buildPresets": [{ "name": "local-debug", "configurePreset": "local", "configuration": "Debug" }] }
   ```
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio (File → Open → Folder) and pick the preset, or from a terminal:
   `cmake --preset local` then `cmake --build --preset local-debug`
4. Start the game with `nvse_loader.exe`. The plugin writes `NVCoop.log` in the game folder.

## Credits
Built on [xNVSE](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE). Facts about the game's memory and functions were learned from the
source of [JIP LN NVSE](https://github.com/jazzisparis/JIP-LN-NVSE), JohnnyGuitar NVSE, kNVSE, ShowOff NVSE and
Real Time Menus, and from reverse engineering with Ghidra; thanks to their authors. AI (Claude) was used as a coding
assistant. No game code is included.

## License
See [LICENSE](LICENSE). In short: use it and change it however you like; don't reupload the original; you may share
a meaningfully changed version (or a project using its code) if you credit this project, say it's modified and not
the official mod, include the license, and publish its full source code under this same license.

**Reusing or rewriting this code?** You're welcome to use the ideas and features. If you copy, port or rewrite the
code itself, by hand or with an AI tool, the [license](LICENSE) asks you to credit it as "based on New Vegas Co-op by
Zyrcxies", keep the license notices and use the same license.
